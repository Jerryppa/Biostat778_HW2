Homework 2 for Biostat 778
==============


## Due: December 4, 2013

## Setup

In order to do this homework you must

1.  **Fork** the
[Biostat778_HW2](https://github.com/rdpeng/Biostat778_HW2) repository
on GitHub

2.  Once you have forked the repository on GitHub, you can **clone**
it to your local computer to actually do the work.

3.  As you are working, make sure to commit changes at logical points
via `git add` and `git commit`.

4.  Once you have completed the assignment, you can push your changes
back to your GitHub repository via `git push`.

5.  Once you have pushed your changes, make a **pull request** on
GitHub so that I can see that you're ready to submit your homework.

7.  Your finished code should be submitted in the form of an **R
package**. The R package should be named **Homework2**.

8.  Your R package should pass `R CMD check` without any warnings,
errors, or notes.

9.  I will put unit tests in the `tests` directory of the R package
for the `master` branch. Please DO NOT make any changes in the `tests`
directory.

10.  You can use the tests in the `tests` directory to check your code
as the expected results will also be in the tests directory.
